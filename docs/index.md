Iâ€™m James Vaughn, a cybersecurity engineer specializing in securing operational technology (OT) environments, with a strong focus on identity and access management. With over a decade of experience, I design and implement security solutions that protect critical infrastructure and industrial systems.

Beyond my professional work, I have a deep passion for technology and continuous learning. My homelab, which began over 20 years ago as a childhood experiment, has grown into a dynamic environment where I explore new technologies, test security strategies, and refine my skills. This blog is where I share insights from both my professional and personal experiences, covering cybersecurity, homelab setups, and emerging tech.

Currently, my homelab features a 5-node Proxmox VE cluster running over 30 virtual machines and containers, an OpnSense firewall, and a diverse range of network, infrastructure, smarthome, and physical security devices.
