To keep up with new technologies and learn those outside the scope of my daily job, I keep up with a homelab.  I started building at home well over 20 years ago as a child when I joined all the computers in the house to Windows Domain and started hosting websites for myself and friends on a local web server. My lab has taken many different forms since then but one thing remains constant - it gives me an outlet for my strong desire to keep learning new things.

## Current State
My homelab currently consists of a 5 node Proxmox VE cluster running 24 virtual machines and containers, an OpnSense firewall, and multiple other network, infrastructure, smarthome, and physical security devices.
